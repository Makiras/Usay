## For what?

Prove your identity, for example you are BYR.

## Code Quality

All code is written by Copilot, so if you find any bug, please report it to him, not me.
No matter what I'm writing, I've already tried my best to make these s**t work.
I have no idea about NEITHER frontend NOR react and python is born for writing rubbish. So don't tell me my code sucks, it's the way it should be.

## Documentation

I will **NOT** write documentation even if GTA â…¥ is released. Just read the source codes.

## Security

There is no database on the server so there is no problem of data leakage. At the same time I am not interested in your personal information because it's useless to me.

## Usage

[JUST READ IT](./manual.md)
